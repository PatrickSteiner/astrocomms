## Providing Power
### Power at the beginning
For the first steps, like connecting PS3 Move Navigation to the Astrocomms, it is sufficient to connect any of the on-board Arduions via their USB-Ports. It obviously makes sense to connect to the one that you want to configure.

### Final Power setup
It might be an overkill, but I like to be on the safe side. So I decided to use a [voltage regulator](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08BRN3R5Y?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to keep stable 12V as my main power. From this I'm using a [voltage transformer](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09B81M5T8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to get stable 5V.

 Both feed their power into a [fuse block](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C58TCRFK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) for further power distribution.

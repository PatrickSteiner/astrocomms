# Astrocomms
This is my personal documentation on using, connecting and customizing [Astrocomms](https://www.printed-droid.com/kb/astrocomms/) from [Printed-Droids](https://www.printed-droid.com/).

This document is rather unstructured at this point in time. You will have to look at the various headlines to see me learnings. Once everything is up-and running and I feel that I learned all that is needed, I will restructure this document to be guideline from **Unpacking** to **playing**.

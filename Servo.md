# Servo Settings
You will need to change some settings for your Servos, maybe the "open" or "close" position or the speed with which a Servo will move from one to the other.

## Body Servos
The Body Servos, like the ones to open/close the Utility Arms, etc are managed via the Arduino Nano of the Astrocomms Ultra Board and connected via the related Pins.
